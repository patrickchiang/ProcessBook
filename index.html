			<p class="point top-2 left-1 right-1">
				This process book documents the design thinking experience and prototyping steps that our team (Team E) took in creating <span class="purple">Welp</span>. It includes everything from abstract concepts like our train of thought and rationale to actual sketches and prototypes we made.
			</p>
			<p class="point top-6 left-1 right-1">
				Our theme was to design something to help students survive college. We believe that <span class="purple">Welp</span> addresses that problem.

			<p class="point top-2 left-1 right-5">
				For defining a problem space, we first asked ourselves what kind of decisions that we or our peers make that while living as college students. We picked food because it was the most relevant and immediate, and it seemed like an easy problem to address, yet we felt it lacked a good solution.

			<p class="point top-3 left-4 right-1">
				To delve more deeply into the problem, we first had to get a sense of where people have a problem with their eating habits outside of the school dorm system. So, we conducted an interview with our peers.

				<p>Some of our questions: </p>
