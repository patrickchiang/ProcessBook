			<h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
			<p class="point top-2 left-1 right-1">
				This process book documents the design thinking experience and prototyping steps that our team (Team E) took in creating <span class="purple">Welp</span>. It includes everything from abstract concepts like our train of thought and rationale to actual sketches and prototypes we made.
			</p>
			<p class="point top-6 left-1 right-1">
				Our theme was to design something to help students survive college. We believe that <span class="purple">Welp</span> addresses that problem.
			</p>

		<div class="parallax slide" id="slide3">
			<p class="point top-2 left-1 right-5">
				For defining a problem space, we first asked ourselves what kind of decisions that we or our peers make that while living as college students. We picked food because it was the most relevant and immediate, and it seemed like an easy problem to address, yet we felt it lacked a good solution.

			<h2 class="title">Contexual Inquiry</h2>

			<p class="point top-3 left-4 right-1">
				To delve more deeply into the problem, we first had to get a sense of where people have a problem with their eating habits outside of the school dorm system. So, we conducted an interview with our peers.
			</p>

			<ul class="point small top-3 left-tiny right-7" data-stellar-ratio="1.3">
				<p>
					Some of our questions:

					When was the last time you ate on the Ave? Where?

				As we got a better idea of what the problem was all about, we entered the brainstorming phase of the project. At this point, we went for quantity over quality, churning out as many ideas as possible, even ones we weren't sure were possible to engineer.

			<h2 class="title">Prototypes</h2>
			<p class="point top-2 left-1 right-1">
				We made three low fidelity paper prototypes: a restaurant searching webapp, a mobile app that tells you how crowded it is, and a rewards program that encourages you to eat at new places.

			<h2 class="title">Prototype Testing</h2>
			<p class="point top-2 left-1 right-1">
				We tested our paper prototypes by showing them to our peers and having them attempt to accomplish a pre-defined set of tasks that most users should encounter in normal usage, and then we asked them which of the 3 they liked best. All of our peers that we interviewed thought that our restaurant searching webapp idea was the most promising. This is where I started working on the higher fidelity prototype of the webapp based on our papers.

				At the time we were facing a difficult conundrum. I knew it would be harder for "the engineer" (me) to make a working prototype. A working prototype was important to me because I thought actually allowing users to have hands on a product would give us much better feedback on how to improve our design. On the other hand, a lot of our peers we interviewed thought that a mobile app would be better.

			<p class="point top-7 left-1 right-1">
				I made it a webapp... one that is friendly to mobile devices.
